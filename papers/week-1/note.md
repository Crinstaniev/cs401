# Note for Paper 1

The discussion topic assigned to me this week is "How".

The methodology employed in this study is divided into two distinct phases: the initial phase involves conducting a cluster analysis on the characteristics of Internet Hypergiants, while the subsequent phase entails an examination of the extent of these entities' reach.

The initial phase of the study comprises an analysis of three distinct attributes of Internet organization as recorded in PeeringDB: geographical distribution, traffic profile, and port capacity. Subsequently, utilizing the K-means algorithm for unsupervised clustering, all organizations were classified into two groups: standard organizations and hypergiants. The study then employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms to establish a robust threshold for clustering. To ensure the robustness of the results, the clustering algorithm was subsequently reapplied to the data samples with added noise. The final outcome of the study identified 15 organizations as hypergiants, while the remaining entities were classified as standard organizations.

Actually (As mentioned by Jiacheng) the methodology employed in this study is divided into two steps: the first step involves conducting a cluster analysis on the characteristics of Internet organizations, and the subsequent step entails an examination of the extent of these entities' reach.

In the second part of the methodology which was mentioned in section 4, the study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of hypergiants by quantifying and comparing the reach of Internet organizations in terms of IP space. To do this, the study defined a variable known as "potential reach," which represents the number of IP addresses that can potentially be reached by an organization through its IXP presence. The potential reach variable was calculated using PeeringDB Routeviews routing information and customer information obtained from CAIDA, which refers to Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis, it conducts some network research and builds research infrastructure to support large-scale data collection, curation, and data distribution to the scientific research community. Subsequently, the study conducted a series of statistical analyses and comparisons between the potential reach of the identified hypergiants previously and that of other organizations.
